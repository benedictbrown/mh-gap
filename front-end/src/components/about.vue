    <h1>PSYCHOSES</h1>
    <p>
      The psychoses module covers management of two severe mental health conditions, psychosis and bipolar disorder. People with psychosis or bipolar disorder are at high risk of exposure to stigma,
      discrimination and violation of their right to live with dignity

      Psychosis is characterised by distorted thoughts and perceptions, as well as disturbed emotions and behaviours. Incoherent or irrelevant speech may also be present. Symptoms such as hallucinations –
      hearing voices, or seeing things that are not there; delusions – fixed, false beliefs; severe abnormalities of behaviour – disorganised behaviour, agitation, excitement, inactivity, or hyperactivity;
      disturbances of emotion – marked apathy, or disconnect between reported emotion and observed affect, such as facial expression and body language, may also be detected.

      Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes in which the person’s mood and activity levels are significantly disturbed. This disturbance consists on some occasions of an elevation of mood and increased
      energy and activity (mania), and on others of a lowering of mood and decreased energy and activity (depression). Characteristically, recovery is complete between episodes. People who experience only
      manic episodes are also classified as having bipolar disorder.
